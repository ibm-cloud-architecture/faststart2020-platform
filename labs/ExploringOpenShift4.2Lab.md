# Exploring OpenShift 4.2 Lab

In this session, you will play a game with OpenShift objects as targets. This game can hopefully help you to better understand OpenShift objects and their intricate relationships. The session starts with an overview of what an OpenShift application is. You will deploy an application to our cluster in your own project and work with its objects to gain a better understanding of how OpenShift objects work.

## Introduction

- Application overview
- Working with an application
- Kubernetes resources


## Step 1 - Accessing OpenShift and preparing your environment

Before you work with this lab, 
make sure your environment has the necessary prerequisites.
You must have the following pre-requisites:

- A Web browser (Chrome or Safari or Firefox)
- Familiarity with running CLI commands in your environment
- Git command line - see https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03
- The `oc` command - download from https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/4.2.16/. Install `openshift-client`, not `openshift-install`.

If you are Mac user, download the `openshift-client-mac-4.2.16.tar.gz` file, untar it with:
```
cd <oc-download-directory>
tar -xvf openshift-client-mac-4.2.16.tar.gz
sudo mv oc /usr/local/bin/oc
```

Lets start with you logging into the cluster. You will be assigned a URL and a login id.

- Console URL: [https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4faststart-aws.faststart.tk](https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4faststart-aws.faststart.tk)
- User ID: `userXX`
- Password:  _________

Follow these instructions to perform the exercise:

1. Open a Web browser and go to the Console URL [https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4faststart-aws.faststart.tk](https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4faststart-aws.faststart.tk)


2. Login with your user ID and password. <br>![OpenShift login](images/001-ocplogin.png)

3. The view on the OpenShift console is the Application Developer view. If you are in the Adminstrator view, select the Administrator drop down and choose Developer. <br>![Developer view](images/301-adminview.png)

4. Click the project dropdown and select **Create Project**. <br>![Create project](images/002-createproj.png)

4. Fill in the Name and Display Name fields with `wild-west-userXX`. To make sure that the project is unique append your userid to the project name and click **Create**. <br>![Project create](images/003-createproj.png)

5. Click on the login name on the top right and select **Copy Login Command**. <br> ![CLI login](images/004-copylogin.png)<br>
If you saved your user id and password on your first login, your `Username` and `Password` fields will be filled in. Otherwise, enter them and click **Login**. On the next screen, click the **Display token** link and copy the `oc login` command to your buffer.<br>![Login command](images/0041-logincmd.png)

6. Now that you have setup your OpenShift environment, lets try to get the application. Open a Command Line (Terminal) session.

7. Paste the login command into the Terminal session and enter it: <br>![Login to openshift](images/005-oclogin.png)



6. Go to an empty working directory and clone the application files from GIT:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/gangchen03/wild-west-Kubernetes
	```

7. Go to the directory `wild-west-Kubernetes/kubernetes`

	```
	cd wild-west-Kubernetes/kubernetes
	```

8. Deploy the application to OpenShift. Look into the file `k8s.yaml` and answer the following questions:

	- How many objects will be created by this yaml file? _____
	- Which object would actually host the application? ____________________ 
	- What application image does it use? _______________________
	- How many pods does the application will run on? ______
	- What are the other objects functions? _____________________________________________

	```
	oc project wild-west-userXX
	oc create -f k8s.yaml
	```

9. Go to the OpenShift console, switch to *Developer* view and click on **Topology** on the left navigation pane. Click on the OpenShift icon to get the detailed information. <br>![OpenShift environment](images/006-topology.png)

	- How many Pods were created? _____
	- What type of service was created? _______________
	- What object(s) have been defined but are not shown in the topology? _________

	Click on one of the Pods. In the Pod view, explore the different tabs: YAML, Logs, Event.
	![OpenShift Pods View](images/007-podview.png)

	Now go to your command line terminal (or console), issue the commmand:
	```
	oc get pods
	```
	You should see all the Pods there.

10. Can you access the application right now? ___________ <br>If yes, what is the URL of the application? __________________________________________

## Step 2 - Work with OpenShift Networking

In the first challenge here, you work to enable the application to be accessed.

1. What object is needed for the application to be accessible for you? ____________<br>
How can you create that object? ___________ or ____________

2. You can use either the Web console or the CLI to create the necessary object. The simplest method is running the CLI command:


	```
	oc get svc
	```
	You should see similar as:
	```
	NAME       TYPE       CLUSTER-IP        EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
	wildwest   NodePort   192.168.128.131   <none>        8080:31995/TCP   8m16s
	```
  
	Now, let's get your service exposed to the Internet.

	```
	oc expose svc wildwest
	```


3. Go back to the topology view. Has a new object been created? ____<br>What is the type of the new object? __________ <br>![Modified topology](images/101-modtopo.png)

4. Now try to understand how these networking objects work:

	- The pods are running and serving the application on port _____
	- The service - load balances the pods and listens on port ______ - for incoming requests from the OpenShift nodes on _______ port.
	- The route detects requests to the URL ______________________________ and then forwards that to the service nodePort.

4. Right-click on the new object to get to your application in a new window, it should look similar to:<br>![wildwestapp](images/102-wildwest.png)

5. Play with the application for a little bit. Have your browser windows with the game and the topology with pod status shown side by side. Is any pod killed/destroyed? Is the game working? _______

### Step 3 - Demonstrate Service Accounts and Role Bindings

Now let's try to see why even when you shoot the Kubernetes objects, they are not affected. Even though you see an explosion in the game, your topology pod status page does not show any pods being terminated. Let's go back and look at the RoleBinding object that you created in the `k8s.yaml` file.

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: view
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: default
```

Pods run based on the authority of a ServiceAccount. In each project, the `default` ServiceAccount runs all pods that are not specifically assigned to any other ServiceAccount.

If you look at the yaml above, you see that the RoleBinding we have deployed allows the ServiceAccount `default` to VIEW objects in the OpenShift cluster. This is a read-only role. Therefore it can discover the pods and services, but the role does not allow the pods to be destroyed or changed.

Lets add the `edit` ClusterRole for the `default` ServiceAccount.

You can create a new YAML file based on the above snippet. In that new file, change all occurrences of `view` to `edit` and save the file. Apply the new YAML file using the command:

  ```
  oc apply -f <yamlfilename>
  ```

  Your yaml file should look like:

  ```
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: RoleBinding
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: edit
  roleRef:
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: edit
  subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: default
  ```

For busy learners, you can just go to the git repo directory and use the `kubernetes/destructive.yaml` file:
```
oc apply -f destructive.yaml
```

Play the game again and check the results. Is it now removing the pods? ______ and how about the services? _______  

You can watch the pods while killing them. Just run the following command:

```
oc get pods -w
```
Ctrl+C to break out the watch.

## Step 4 - Demonstrate Storage provisioning

OpenShift dynamic storage provisioning allows the creation of a PhysicalVolumeClaim (PVC) based on a StorageClass. That means that an application can directly request a PVC without individually creating a PhysicalVolume (PV) to back it up.

1. In the OpenShift environment, check whether you have a StorageClass defined. Change to the Administrator view from the Developer view from the OpenShift Web console. <br>![Admin view](images/301-adminview.png)

2. Select in the left Navigation menu **Storage > Storage Classes** - take note of the storage class name.

3. Now go to **Storage > Persistent Volume Claims** and click **Create Persistent Volume Claim**; select the Storage Class, give a name and size (1 Gi) and click **Create**. <br>![create pvc](images/302-createpvc.png)

4. In the PersistentVolumeClaim page, the PVC status will remain as `Pending`. This is because on the public cloud we are using, the PVC does not become bound until a pod actually connects with it. It is OK for you to proceed to the next step with the PVC in the `Pending` state. 

<!-- 
<br>![pvc](images/303pvcbound.png)
-->

5. Go back to the game and wait until a PVC object is shown (similar to a Drum or a Disk). When you click on it, go back to the PVC page and refresh it. It will show a 404 because the PVC is no longer there. <br>![pvc gone](images/304-notfound.png)


## Step 5 - Challenge: Why is the service not getting deleted? Explore the Source code (**Optional**)

Now that the game is working, destroying cluster components as you click on them, what about the service? The service never gets destroyed when you click on the icon. Why?

_Hint_:
The source is in the file `PlatformObjectHelper.java`

## Step 6 - Explore OpenShift Application Deployment tools

Now that you already understand how to deploy applications to OpenShift, be aware that what you just did in the previous exercises is applicable to any Kubernetes environment, not just to OpenShift. 
Now let's try working with some OpenShift specific resources. These resources are the **BuildConfig** and the **DeploymentConfig**. 
The BuildConfig allows OpenShift to detect changes in the source application and automatically build the container image for deployment. 
This feature is called **Source2Image (S2I)**. The container image from the BuildConfig is packaged into a DeploymentConfig, which is essentially a deployment with additional capabilities. 

In the previous exercises, a separate YAML definition is needed to just deploy an existing image from Dockerhub. So let's perform a new application creation directly from a github repository using the Source2Image capability.

1. From the command line, run the following command, substituting your user name at the end:

	```
	oc new-app openshift/java:11~https://github.com/gangchen03/wild-west-kubernetes.git --name=wildwest-s2i --env "K8S_NAMESPACE=wild-west-userXX"
	```

	![New Application](images/600-newapp.png)

	- How many objects are created from this command? ________
	- How an imagestream differs from a simple Container image? _______________________
	- Apart from the imagestream and service, what other object types are created? ________________ and ________________

2. Check the BuildConfig object. From the OpenShift Console, go to **Builds** > **Build Configs**. Select the BuildConfig that you created and answer the following questions:

	- How does the BuildConfig run the build process? ________
	- Where is the output of the build process stored? __________________
	- Specify one event that can initiate the build process? ____________________

	![BuildConfig](images/601-buildconfig.png)

3. Click on the **Builds** tab, select the most recent build and then go to the **Logs** tab. If the build is not complete, you should wait until the end of the log shows `Push successful`.

	- What are the steps being performed? ___________________
	- Where does the image get stored? ______________________________

	![Build log](images/6011-buildlog.png)

4. Switch back to the Developer view and select **Topology**. <br>![Topology with DC](images/602-topology.png)

5. Select the DeploymentConfig object and evaluate the object properties. <br>![DeploymentConfig](images/603-dc.png)

	- How many pods does it have? ___________
	- Does it have a route? __________

6. Expose the implemented service:

	```
	oc expose svc wildwest-s2i
	```

7. What do you think the route will be called? _________________________________
<br>Can you access the application? _______


8. Now let's have a little bit more fun. So far, you've been deploying somebody else's code (either through container image or from git source code). How about change the source code and deploy to OpenShift? Ideally, you would git fork the original git repository (https://github.com/gangchen03/wild-west-kubernetes) then edit the source code from your git fork. For simpliciity, we'll just let you work on the code locally. And yes, OpenShift allows you to deploy changed source code from the local file system via s2i.

	Let's modify the game index HTML page. Go to the main repository directory that you cloned in Step 1:
	```
	cd wild-west-kubernetes 
	```

	Edit the static index.html using your favorite text editor such as:

	```
	vi src/main/resources/static/index.html   
	```

	Locate the line `<h1>Wild West</h1>` (line 25) and change it to:
	```
	<h1>Wild West FastStart</h1>
	```
	Save the change (`:wq!`).

9. Deploy the updated source code by triggering the OpenShift build. When you created the new app in step one, OpenShift automatically created a BuildConfig object for you:

	```
	oc get bc
	```

	Now, start a new build:
	```
	oc start-build bc/wildwest-s2i --from-dir=.
	```
	This tells OpenShift that you will build the Application with source from local directory.
	Watch the build process:

	```
	oc logs -f bc/wildwest-s2i
	```

10. Validate your change. Open the browser to the game page, you should see your change as shown below:
  ![Application Change](images/0010-applicationchg.png)


## Step 7 - Clean up

Please clean up after yourself. Run the following commands from your terminal session:

```
oc delete rolebinding edit
oc delete rolebinding view
oc delete route wildwest
oc delete service wildwest
oc delete deployment wildwest
oc delete route wildwest-s2i
oc delete service wildwest-s2i
oc delete deploymentconfig wildwest-s2i
oc delete buildconfig wildwest-s2i
oc delete imagestream wildwest-s2i
oc delete project wild-west-userXX
oc logout
```
